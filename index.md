I am a second year PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science at University of California](https://cs.ics.uci.edu/), Irvine where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Ioannis Panageas](https://panageas.github.io/). Prior to that, I obtained a BS degree at Department of Mathmatics at University of California, Irvine.

My Research interests lie in the area of Game Theory, Min-Max Optimization, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, and Convex/Non-Convex Optimization.
