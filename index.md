I am a third year PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science at University of California, Irvine](https://cs.ics.uci.edu/) where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Ioannis Panageas](https://panageas.github.io/). Prior to that, I obtained a BS degree at Department of Mathmatics at University of California, Irvine. Here you can find my [CV](Jingming-Yan.github.io/CV.pdf) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XXg_F6AAAAAJ&hl=en) profile.
